- atm we do animation differentiation for Texture packers spritesheet creation with the naming:
-> therefore every animation needs to have its own name ending with framenumber "_x" (x = 1..)

- later we can introduce own exporter in Texturepacker (see: https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker/documentation/custom-exporter)
-> distinguish coudl be in the meta section like with aseprite json - exporter
