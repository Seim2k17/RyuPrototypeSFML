- WE DEF: need to rethink the movement "system" -> implem jumping is difficult and awful
-> ze.g.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbtcEVCM7bw
- at some point we have cyclic dependencies and we needed to add to certain libs other libs to CMakeLists
- to avoid these cyclic deps we had to make some libs static -> is this good or bad or can we organize the
libs better ?

- for some reason we only can import configData in the AnimationEditor only for Anis of type: "Character"
-> if there is one ANi tagged "SCene" -> wie cannot import the config correctly

- pause input when Animator is open
- read animation config files and set preferences in Animator, to continue work ...
  - use file browser to parse config file

x !!! debugdraw right no tirdparty, include it directly and either with SFML or opengl !!! very important for box2d debugging
x remove thirdparty debug stuff from cmakelists
x make cmakelists easier


4/11/22:
- docu, what we can do already etc ... docu code !
- physics boxes destructable
- physics for character only falling, collision
- try transparent textures with light outlines for physicbodies (debug)
x move physcsbody when character moves

12/10/22:
- set position of player (spawnposition)
- cleanup playercontroller/handle input

9/10/22:
- animationsystem: timing per frame allowed

7/10/22:
- nice logger (activatable, categories etc ... see open source c++ libs)

19/9/22:
x entity, 
x scenegraph, 
x world, 
x assetmamager update

10/9/22:
- use component driven design for character/npc etc ?!
    - see gamedevelopment design repo ! git@github.com:TankOs/GDD.git
x use smart pointers for states
- implement rule of 5

6/9/22:

X implement Texture/AssetManager-class (see Texture holder pg. 38 SFML-GDBook)
    X see also chapter 02_SFML_GD_BOOK/02_Resources
    X generalize this for all the other assets not just textures and no extra classes for fonts, sounds etc ...
